            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant.[10]
                All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "corm".[11] Plants
                are normally tall and fairly sturdy with a treelike appearance, but what appears to be a trunk is
                actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is
                at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.[12] Banana plants are
                among the fastest growing of all plants, with daily surface growth rates recorded
                from 1.4 square metres (15 sq ft) to 1.6 square metres </p>

            <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
            <p>The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[36]
                The name may be derived from Antonius Musa, physician to
                the Emperor Augustus, or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic
                word for banana, mauz.[37] According to Roger Blench, the
                ultimate origin of musa is in the Trans–New Guinea languages,
                whence they were borrowed into the Austronesian languages
                and across Asia, via the Dravidian languages of India,
                into Arabic as a Wanderwort.[38]</p>

            <h2>Historical cultivation</h2>
            <p>The earliest domestication of bananas (Musa spp.) was from naturally occurring parthenocarpic (seedless)
                individuals of Musa banksii in New Guinea. These were cultivated by Papuans before the arrival of
                Austronesian-speakers. Numerous phytoliths of bananas have been recovered from the Kuk Swamp
                archaeological site and dated to around 10,000 to 6,500 BP.[56][57][58] Foraging humans in this area
                began domestication in the late Pleistocene using transplantation and early cultivation methods.[59][60]
                Various investigations[60][59] – including Denham et al.</p>

            <p>Bananas boast a cheerful and 
                classic yellow hue, radiating a vibrant energy 
                that is instantly recognizable. This sunny color 
                is not only visually appealing but also indicative of the
                 fruit's ripeness.</p>

            <img src="./Document_files/card2.png">
            <p>The gentle curve of a banana gives it a distinctive and ergonomic shape. This natural bend makes it easy to peel and enjoy, 
                while also contributing to the
                 banana's unique appearance.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="./Document_files/card3.jpeg">
            <p>The smooth contours of a banana
                 create a seamless transition
                  from top to bottom. 
                  This sleek design not only
                   enhances the fruit's aesthetic appeal but also makes it a delight to hold and eat.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="./Document_files/card4.jpg">
            <p>Before ripening into their iconic yellow, bananas often start with a subtle green tint. This early color variation adds an interesting element to the banana's journey from the orchard to the fruit bowl.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="./Document_files/card5.jpeg">
            <p>As bananas mature, they transform into a golden yellow, signaling the peak of ripeness. This rich color is not only a visual indicator but also a promise of the fruit's sweet and creamy flavor.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="./Document_files/card6.jpeg">
            <p>While yellow is the most common color, bananas can exhibit various shades, including pale yellow, deep yellow, and even hints of green. This diversity adds visual interest to the bunch.</p>

            <img src="./Document_files/card7.jpg">
            <p>Bananas are characterized by their compact and elongated form, creating an elegant silhouette. This simplicity contributes to the fruit's popularity as a convenient, on-the-go snack.</p>

            <img src="./Document_files/card8.jpeg">
            <p>The banana's peel, with its slightly rough texture, provides a tactile contrast to the fruit's smooth interior. Peeling a banana becomes a satisfying experience, unveiling the delicious treat within.</p>
