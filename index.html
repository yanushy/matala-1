            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant.[10]
                All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "corm".[11] Plants
                are normally tall and fairly sturdy with a treelike appearance, but what appears to be a trunk is
                actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is
                at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.[12] Banana plants are
                among the fastest growing of all plants, with daily surface growth rates recorded
                from 1.4 square metres (15 sq ft) to 1.6 square metres </p>

            <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
            <p>The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[36]
                The name may be derived from Antonius Musa, physician to
                the Emperor Augustus, or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic
                word for banana, mauz.[37] According to Roger Blench, the
                ultimate origin of musa is in the Trans–New Guinea languages,
                whence they were borrowed into the Austronesian languages
                and across Asia, via the Dravidian languages of India,
                into Arabic as a Wanderwort.[38]</p>

            <h2>Historical cultivation</h2>
            <p>The earliest domestication of bananas (Musa spp.) was from naturally occurring parthenocarpic (seedless)
                individuals of Musa banksii in New Guinea. These were cultivated by Papuans before the arrival of
                Austronesian-speakers. Numerous phytoliths of bananas have been recovered from the Kuk Swamp
                archaeological site and dated to around 10,000 to 6,500 BP.[56][57][58] Foraging humans in this area
                began domestication in the late Pleistocene using transplantation and early cultivation methods.[59][60]
